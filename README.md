# Installation04

## Introduction:

Welcome to the **Installation04** project, a **cryptocurrency price movement prediction webApp using machine learning**. This project was developed as a graduation project, and it involved months of research, data collection, processing, model training and selection, and website design and implementation. This readme file will provide an overview of the contents of this repository.

## Data:

The data used for training the neural network models is stored in CSV files, and different types of data were collected and researched to find the best data for training the models. The data is clean, without any jumps or duplicates, and gaps in the data were filled using constant or linear interpolation, depending on what worked best. These CSV files are included in this repository.

## Code:

The code for training the neural network models on the data is also included in this repository. The final iteration of the feature creation and data preprocessing process is included, and the code is modular, making it easy to experiment with different types of data and settings for the training.

## Website Project Files:

The website for this project was created using Flask, and the full project files are included in this repository. The latest models, model files, and scalers are also included in the website project files. The database used for this project needs to be in "WebsiteProjectFiles/App/CryptoDB.db", and it must contain the past 3 months of data for the models to run correctly. If there is missing data in the database, the models will run, but the results may not be accurate.

## Data Collection Programs:

To ensure that the website is up-to-date with the latest data, real-time data is collected using various websites. The data collection programs are also included in this repository.

## Conclusion:

This repository contains all the code and data that were used for the **Installation04** project. If you're interested in cryptocurrency price movement prediction using machine learning, this project can provide valuable insights and serve as a starting point for your own research.
